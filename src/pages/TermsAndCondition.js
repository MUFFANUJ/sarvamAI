              <p>
                Inflection AI believes that conversational AI will fundamentally
                reshape the way that we interact and use computers in our
                everyday lives. As you interact with our Services, we will learn
                more about how to make this emerging technology ever more
                helpful, collaborative, and fun to communicate with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given the early state of this technology, we also acknowledge
                that there are areas that we will need to continually improve on
                to make sure that our Services can reach their full potential.
